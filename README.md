# 🌟 Tomiwa Jinadu's Portfolio 🚀  
**Live Site:** [tomiwajinadu-portfolio-v2.vercel.app](https://tomiwajinadu-portfolio-v2.vercel.app)

A second iteration of my personal site — built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and animated with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).  
Inspired by clean, performant developer portfolios and designed to reflect both personality and professionalism.
